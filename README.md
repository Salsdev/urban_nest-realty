## About

Urban Nest is a real estate application designed to help people find their ideal homes. It was inspired by the rising cost of housing in Nigeria and the substantial yet insufficient real estate market across the country, particularly in the northern region. The platform aims to bridge this gap by offering a user-friendly interface and robust search features.

Additionally, the inspiration for Urban Nest comes from successful models like Airbnb and the concept of real estate freedom, emphasizing the importance of accessible housing solutions for all. Through this app, we strive to provide users with the resources and tools they need to navigate the real estate landscape effectively.
This project was developed as a portfolio project for Alx School.
